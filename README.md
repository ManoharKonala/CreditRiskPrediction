# CreditRiskPrediction

This project predicts credit risk using machine learning and provides interactive data visualizations with Tableau.

## Structure

- `Ml Model/PredictionModel.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Ml Model/credit_risk_model_updated.pkl`: Trained machine learning model (pickle file) for deployment or inference.
- `GrossApproval&NaisDescription.twbx`: Tableau dashboard for gross approvals and NAIS descriptions.
- `Visualizations Using Tableau.twb`: Additional Tableau visualizations.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook to review and run the machine learning workflow.
2. Use the provided `.pkl` model for predictions on new data.
3. Open Tableau workbooks in Tableau Desktop to explore dashboards and insights.

## Requirements

- Python (with Jupyter Notebook)
- Required Python libraries (see notebook)
